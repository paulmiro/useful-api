# A very useful API that does very useful things (100% vibe-coded)

# [useful-api.party](https://useful-api.party)

## 🚀 Overview

This is a very useful API that does very useful things. Built with Rust and Rocket, it provides endpoints for calculating satoshi-related conversions with a focus on real-world applications like Mensa meals and Congress-Beers, as well as checking stock for our favorite sharks.

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI at [`/swagger-ui/`](https://useful-api.party/swagger-ui).

The server at [useful-api.party](https://useful-api.party) automatically updates from the `main` branch every 5 minutes.

## 🎉 Contributions

**✨ *We want as many Pull Requests as possible!* ✨**

**EVERY** PR will be merged, *as long as it adheres to these guidelines (in order of importance)*:

- ✅ It is 100% vibe-coded.
- 🛠️ It compiles.
- 🛡️ It is not malware.

Things that do not matter (in no particular order):

- 🚫 Code quality *(as long as it compiles)*
- 📚 Code readability *(no human will ever have to read it)*
- 💨 Performance *(it's written in rust, so bad performance is impossible)*
- 🤔 Usefulness to the user *(who could even decide what counts as "useful"?)*
- 🚀 Scalability *(it runs on my machine, so it will probably scale to a billion users)*
- 🧪 Test coverage *(untested code is the purest code)*
- 📖 Documentation *(the code is self-documenting, if you can read it)*
- 🐛 Error handling *(errors are just unexpected features)*
- ⏪ Backward compatibility *(if it breaks, they shouldn't have used it)*
- 🔮 Future-proofing *(tomorrow's problems are for tomorrow's agents)*
